# Contributing

Our site and README are generated from the lists defined in code. **Links are no longer edited directly in the README.** To contribute links you will need to modify the collection you want to update and submit that to us with a new GitHub Pull Request (PR). You can do that directly on GitHub by clicking the `Edit` button on the top right of the page when viewing any of the collection files:

_Do not edit any other files as updating a generated file will cause your changes to be lost._

Choose the collection to edit:

- [Audio Plugins](./data/plugins.json)
- [Collections](./data/collections.json)
- [Audio Apps](./data/apps.json)
- [Software Development Libraries](./data/libraries.json)
- [Code Samples](./data/samples.json)
- [Open Data Resources](./data/resources.json)
