Open Source Audio Plugins & Apps
===================

A list of open source VST (and other format) plugin/app projects. The intention of this list is to catalog open source plugins or apps which are fully featured or are useful examples which have non-trivial features.

The main benefit of having Open Source plugins/apps is that the code itself is preserved for the future, so when the author(s) stop updating it the community can continue using and developing the software. Open Source projects are also a great way to learn how different audio FX/instruments are created.
